# Web-Bassed Calculator App

This application was written using React. You can learn more about React [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

This project was implemented with the goal of learning a web application framework. There are several webframe work out there among which are: django that uses python, NodeJs, and React which uses the power of JavaScript.

This web based calculator is interractive and it solves basic mathematical calculations.
